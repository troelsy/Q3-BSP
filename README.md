Q3-BSP
======
This is a module for Python used to load BSP maps into readable data. The interface of the module is
really simple; when creating an instance of the LoadBSP class, you tell what BSP file to load using
the fname argument of __init__ and the map will then begin loading. When the map is loaded, you can
use the get() method to retrive the data of each "lump". Here is an example:  

```
import LoadBSP  

```
